# Import Settings

Import configuration to a server. If you don't specify a `to`, we look for a CommandBox server using the current working directory. Only rely on this if you have a single CommandBox server running in the current directory.

```text
cfconfig import myConfig.json
cfconfig import to=serverName from=myConfig.json
cfconfig import to=/path/to/server/home from=myConfig.json
```

All the same rules for engine format and version apply.

```text
cfconfig import from=/path/to/.CFConfig.json to=/path/to/server/home toFormat=luceeServer@5.1
```

The version number can be left off `toFormat` and `fromFormat` when reading or writing to a CFConfig JSON file or a CommandBox server since we already know the version. If you don't specify a Lucee web or Server context, we default to server. Use a format of `luceeWeb` to switch.

```text
cfconfig import from=myConfig.json toFormat=luceeWeb
```

### IncludeList and excludeList

You can customize what config settings are transferred with the `includeList` and `excludeList` params. If at least one include pattern is provided, **only** matching settings will be included. Nested keys such as `datasources.myDSN` or `mailservers[1]` can be used. You may also use basic wildcards in your pattern. A single `*` will match any number of chars inside a key name. A double `**` will match any number of nested keys.

```bash
# Include all settings starting with "event"
cfconfig import from=.CFConfig.json includeList=event*
# Exclude all keys called "password" regardless of what struct they are in
cfconfig import from=.CFConfig.json excludeList=**.password
```

### Append flag

Use the `append` parameter to merge incoming data with any data already present. For example, if a server already has one datasource defined, and you import a JSON file with 2 more unique datasources, the `--append` flag will not remove the pre-existing one.

```bash
cfconfig import from=.CFConfig.json includeList=datasources --append
```
